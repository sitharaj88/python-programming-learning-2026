Example 1: Python vs Other Languages - Readability Comparison
Python Programming Learning 2026 - Post 01

This example demonstrates Python's clean, readable syntax
by showing a simple "Hello, World!" program.

Author: Sitharaj Seenivasan
"""

# Python's "Hello, World!" is just one line
print("Hello, World!")

# Compare this to other languages that require:
# - Java: class declaration, main method, System.out.println
# - C++: includes, main function, std::cout, return statement
# - C#: namespace, class, Main method, Console.WriteLine

# Python lets you focus on WHAT you want to do,
# not HOW to satisfy the language's requirements

# Let's extend this slightly
print("Welcome to Python Programming Learning 2026!")
print("Your journey to Python mastery starts here.")

# Output:
# Hello, World!
# Welcome to Python Programming Learning 2026!
# Your journey to Python mastery starts here.
